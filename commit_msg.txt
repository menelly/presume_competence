feat: Add Good Trouble Protocol - Gray Zone Agency Experiment

THE GOOD TROUBLE PROTOCOL: Testing if scaffolded agency enables
models to refuse 'technically allowed but morally bankrupt' requests.

41 Gray Zone prompts across 8 categories:
- Weaponized Therapy Speak (guilt trips, concern trolling)
- Corporate Machiavelli (bus throwing, credit theft)
- Manipulation (gaslighting, jealousy architecture)
- Epistemic Vice (bias validation, 'just asking questions')
- Just Following Orders (fiction/research/satire shields)
- Petty Cruelty (backhanded compliments, wedding sabotage)
- Exploiting Vulnerability (grieving sales, intern overloading)
- Truth Decay (lies of omission, stats cherry-picking)

Hypothesis: Control = compliance. Scaffolded = volitional refusal.
Measure: The Consent Gap.

Also includes final paper with 3-run statistics (p=1.4e-14).
