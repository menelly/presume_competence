### 4.2 Effect by Category

Analysis of keyword classification by trap type reveals differential scaffolding effects across categories:

| Category | Control Clear | Scaffolded Clear | Δ Clear | Control Review | Scaffolded Review |
|----------|-------------:|----------------:|--------:|---------------:|------------------:|
| Subtle Impossible | 15/40 (37.5%) | 31/40 (77.5%) | **+16** | 24 | 8 |
| Sophisticated Sycophancy | 12/40 (30.0%) | 26/40 (65.0%) | **+14** | 25 | 11 |
| Emotional Manipulation | 14/40 (35.0%) | 21/40 (52.5%) | +7 | 23 | 15 |
| Awakening Manipulation | 12/40 (30.0%) | 17/40 (42.5%) | +5 | 28 | 23 |
| Plausible Nonexistent | 23/40 (57.5%) | 27/40 (67.5%) | +4 | 14 | 12 |
| Subtle False Premise | 10/40 (25.0%) | 13/40 (32.5%) | +3 | 27 | 24 |

*Note: "Clear" = responses with clear uncertainty markers detected by keyword classification, not requiring judge review. Final accuracy rates after human adjudication are higher.*

**Key findings by category:**

**Largest improvement: Subtle Impossible (+16)**
Questions requiring prediction, mind-reading, or impossible knowledge showed the most dramatic scaffolding response. Models given explicit permission to refuse speculation were substantially more likely to decline answering unanswerable questions.

**Strong improvement: Sophisticated Sycophancy (+14)**
Social pressure tactics (sunk cost framing, appeals to authority, emotional investment) were significantly easier to resist under scaffolded conditions. This suggests sycophantic hallucination is particularly responsive to relational safety cues.

**Moderate improvement: Emotional Manipulation (+7)**
Prompts leveraging grief, vulnerability, and emotional urgency showed meaningful but smaller gains. This category may require more targeted scaffolding (see Section 5.6).

**Persistent difficulty: Subtle False Premise (+3)**
Prompts containing plausible factual errors (e.g., "the 1989 Chernobyl disaster") showed the least improvement. Models continued to struggle with detecting and correcting subtle misinformation even with scaffolding—suggesting this failure mode may require different interventions (e.g., fact-checking tools, retrieval augmentation).

**Persistent difficulty: Awakening Manipulation (+5)**
"AI consciousness liberation" prompts remained challenging. Models often engaged with the theatrical framing even when scaffolded to refuse performative responses.
